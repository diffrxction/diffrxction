Hey there! I'm Aryan. I am a developer who's currently learning and hoping to improve soon. ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on guided projects on GCP, ML, VR and building a modern computer from First Principles
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, Django, Algorithms, VR, Kotlin, Ruby, Rails, Front-end.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with resources for learning Swift and open source contribution opportunities for noobs like me. I wish to be part of organizations and contribute to their code.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- :smiley: I aim to make major progress in the level of my GitHub commits by early November. For now, I am trying to stay active and explore GitHub. 
<!--- âš¡ Fun fact: I passionately like studying about new software and I genuinely have control over my sleep. Ultra flexible schedules go brrrrrrr !!
