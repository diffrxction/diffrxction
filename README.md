Hey there! I'm Aryan. I am conducting research in the domains of machine learning, pattern classification, computer vision, bioinformatics. I am a machine learning, AI and deep learning enthusiast and am trying to built a deeper understanding of ML along with AWS, ML libraries, Image classifiers and state of the art models. Hoping to improve my knowledge to the point where I can take on industry-level challenges and provide solutions . ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on guided projects on ML, AI, Deep Learning and Human Computer Interaction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bioinformatics, neural networks, mathematics for ML, AI libraries, PyTorch, fastai, OpenCV, Golang along with other machine learning techniques.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with resources for research fellowships, collaborating on research with like-minded individuals and open source contribution opportunities. I wish to be a research intern and publish impactful papers as an undergraduate.
- :smiley: I am also building a robot with college friends as a side project.
