Hey there! I'm Aryan. I am a machine learning enthusiast and am currently working on some maths for ML along with AWS, ML libraries, Image classifiers and state of the art models. Hoping to improve my knowledge to the point where I can take on challenges and conduct detailed research for solutions . ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on guided projects on ML, AI, Deep Learning and Human Computer Interaction.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, advanced mathematics for ML, AI libraries, PyTorch, fastai, OpenCV, Golang along with other machine learning techniques.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with resources for research and open source contribution opportunities. I wish to be a research intern and publish impactful papers as an undergraduate.
- :smiley: I aim to make major progress in my open source contricutins on GitHub. For now, I am trying to stay active and explore research topics.
